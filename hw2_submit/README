Since part 5 is the super set of all parts. Comments about functions, variables can be found in source code of part 5.

Modified BNF for part5:
The rule for statement is modified as:
statement ::= assignment | print | do | if | for
One rule for 'for' is added
for ::= '{' expr '$' expr '$' expr '$' block '}'
Description: 
1st expr: set the initial value for the iterator
2nd expr: the stopping condition, for loop terminates when iterator's value equals to this condition
3rd expr: the step value of the iterator, after one round, the iterator is added the value as specified.
